**DentalPrime Ingredients**
---------------------------

DentalPrime is formulated with a blend of high-quality, natural ingredients designed to support oral health effectively. Here are the key ingredients:

**Calcium** - Calcium is a vital mineral renowned for maintaining strong teeth and bones. In DentalPrime, calcium supports teeth’ structural integrity, helping prevent decay and erosion. This mineral contributes to the remineralization process of enamel, which is essential in safeguarding against cavities. Sufficient calcium intake is crucial for both children and adults, as it enhances the density of the jawbone and supports the overall health of the oral cavity.

**Xylitol** - Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol that is known for its dental health benefits. It is often used as a sweetener in various dental products due to its ability to inhibit the growth of cavity-causing bacteria. Xylitol helps to neutralize acids in the mouth, reducing the risk of tooth decay and promoting a healthier oral environment. By incorporating xylitol into DentalPrime, the formulation not only tastes great but also actively contributes to oral health by promoting remineralization of tooth enamel and reducing the risk of cavities.

**Vitamin D3 (as Cholecalciferol)** - Helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, vital for strong teeth and bones. It supports enamel remineralization, strengthens the jawbone, and enhances immunity to fight gum infections, promoting overall oral health.

**Vitamin K2 (as Menaquinone-7)** - Works with Vitamin D3 to direct calcium to teeth and bones while preventing its buildup in soft tissues. It helps strengthen tooth structure, supports gum health, and maintains bone density for a healthy smile.

**Cranberry Powder -** Is rich in antioxidants and natural compounds that prevent harmful bacteria from sticking to teeth and gums. It helps reduce plaque formation, supports healthy gums, prevents bad breath, and protects oral tissues from inflammation and infection.

**Zinc (as Zinc Citrate)** - Offers strong antibacterial and healing properties, reducing plaque buildup and bad breath. It supports gum repair, enhances oral tissue health, prevents demineralization of enamel, and boosts the mouth’s natural defense against bacteria.
